            <li><strong>Weight Management:</strong> Exercise 1 - Building a Basic Project
                The most basic CMake project is an executable built from a single source code file. For simple projects like this, a CMakeLists.txt file with three commands is all that is required.
                
                Note: Although upper, lower and mixed case commands are supported by CMake, lower case commands are preferred and will be used throughout the tutorial.
                
                Any project's top most CMakeLists.txt must start by specifying a minimum CMake version using the cmake_minimum_required() command. This establishes policy settings and ensures that the following CMake functions are run with a compatible version of CMake.
                
                To start a project, we use the project() command to set the project name. This call is required with every project and should be called soon after cmake_minimum_required(). As we will see later, this command can also be used to specify other project level information such as the language or version number.
                
                Finally, the add_executable() command tells CMake to create an executable using the specified source code files.
                
                Goal

                Files to Edit
                CMakeLists.txt
                
                Getting Started
                The source code for tutorial.cxx is provided in the Help/guide/tutorial/Step1 directory and can be used to compute the square root of a number. This file does not need to be edited in this step.
                
                In the same directory is a CMakeLists.txt file which you will complete. Start with TODO 1 and work through TODO 3.
                
                Build and Run
                Once TODO 1 through TODO 3 have been completed, we are ready to build and run our project! First, run the cmake executable or the cmake-gui to configure the project and then build it with your chosen build tool.
                
                For example, from the command line we could navigate to the Help/guide/tutorial directory of the CMake source code tree and create a build directory:
                
                mkdir Step1_build
                Next, navigate to that build directory and run cmake to configure the project and generate a native build system:
                
                cd Step1_build
                cmake ../Step1
                Then call that build system to actually compile/link the project:
                
                cmake --build .
                For multi-config generators (e.g. Visual Studio), first navigate to the appropriate subdirectory, for example:
                
                cd Debug
                Finally, try to use the newly built Tutorial:
                
                Tutorial 4294967296
                Tutorial 10
                Tutorial
                Note: Depending on the shell, the correct syntax may be Tutorial, ./Tutorial or .\Tutorial. For simplicity, the exercises will use Tutorial throughout.
                
                Solution
                As mentioned above, a three line CMakeLists.txt is all that we need to get up and running. The first line is to use cmake_minimum_required() to set the CMake version as follows:
                
                TODO 1: Click to show/hide answer
                The next step to make a basic project is to use the project() command as follows to set the project name:
                
                TODO 2: Click to show/hide answer
                The last command to call for a basic project is add_executable(). We call it as follows:
                
                TODO 3: Click to show/hide answer
                Exercise 2 - Specifying the C++ Standard
                CMake has some special variables that are either created behind the scenes or have meaning to CMake when set by project code. Many of these variables start with CMAKE_. Avoid this naming convention when creating variables for your projects. Two of these special user settable variables are CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD and CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED. These may be used together to specify the C++ standard needed to build the project.
                
                Goal
                Add a feature that requires C++11.

                set()
                
                Files to Edit
                CMakeLists.txt
                
                tutorial.cxx
                
                Getting Started
                Continue editing files in the Step1 directory. Start with TODO 4 and complete through TODO 6.
                
                First, edit tutorial.cxx by adding a feature that requires C++11. Then update CMakeLists.txt to require C++11.
                
                Build and Run
                Let's build our project again. Since we already created a build directory and ran CMake for Exercise 1, we can skip to the build step:
                
                cd Step1_build
                cmake --build .
                Now we can try to use the newly built Tutorial with same commands as before:
                
                Tutorial 4294967296
                Tutorial 10
                Tutorial
                Solution
                We start by adding some C++11 features to our project by replacing atof with std::stod in tutorial.cxx. This looks like the following:
                
                TODO 4: Click to show/hide answer
                To complete TODO 5, simply remove #include <cstdlib>.
                
                We will need to explicitly state in the CMake code that it should use the correct flags. One way to enable support for a specific C++ standard in CMake is by using the CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD variable. For this tutorial, set the CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD variable in the CMakeLists.txt file to 11 and CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED to True. Make sure to add the CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD declarations above the call to add_executable().
                
                TODO 6: Click to show/hide answer
                Exercise 3 - Adding a Version Number and Configured Header File
                Sometimes it may be useful to have a variable that is defined in your CMakelists.txt file also be available in your source code. In this case, we would like to print the project version.
                
                One way to accomplish this is by using a configured header file. We create an input file with one or more variables to replace. These variables have special syntax which looks like @VAR@. Then, we use the configure_file() command to copy the input file to a given output file and replace these variables with the current value of VAR in the CMakelists.txt file.
                
                While we could edit the version directly in the source code, using this feature is preferred since it creates a single source of truth and avoids duplication.
                
                Goal
                Define and report the project's version number.
                
                Helpful Resources

                configure_file()

                tutorial.cxx
                
                Getting Started
                Continue to edit files from Step1. Start on TODO 7 and complete through TODO 12. In this exercise, we start by adding a project version number in CMakeLists.txt. In that same file, use configure_file() to copy a given input file to an output file and substitute some variable values in the input file content.
                
                Next, create an input header file TutorialConfig.h.in defining version numbers which will accept variables passed from configure_file().
                
                Finally, update tutorial.cxx to print out its version number.
                
                Build and Run
                Let's build our project again. As before, we already created a build directory and ran CMake so we can skip to the build step:
                
                cd Step1_build
                cmake --build .
                Verify that the version number is now reported when running the executable without any arguments.
                
                Solution
                In this exercise, we improve our executable by printing a version number. While we could do this exclusively in the source code, using CMakeLists.txt lets us maintain a single source of data for the version number.
                
                First, we modify the CMakeLists.txt file to use the project() command to set both the project name and version number. When the project() command is called, CMake defines Tutorial_VERSION_MAJOR and Tutorial_VERSION_MINOR behind the scenes.
                
                TODO 7: Click to show/hide answer
                Then we used configure_file() to copy the input file with the specified CMake variables replaced:
                
                TODO 8: Click to show/hide answer
                Since the configured file will be written into the project binary directory, we must add that directory to the list of paths to search for include files.
                
                Note: Throughout this tutorial, we will refer to the project build and the project binary directory interchangeably. These are the same and are not meant to refer to a bin/ directory.
                
                We used target_include_directories() to specify where the executable target should look for include files.
                
                TODO 9: Click to show/hide answer
                TutorialConfig.h.in is the input header file to be configured. When configure_file() is called from our CMakeLists.txt, the values for @Tutorial_VERSION_MAJOR@ and @Tutorial_VERSION_MINOR@ will be replaced with the corresponding version numbers from the project in TutorialConfig.h.
                
                TODO 10: Click to show/hide answer
                Next, we need to modify tutorial.cxx to include the configured header file, TutorialConfig.h.
                
                TODO 11: Click to show/hide answer
                Finally, we print out the executable name and version number by updating tutorial.cxx as follows:
                
                TODO 12: Click to show/hide answer</li>
